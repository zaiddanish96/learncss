    CSS inline styles can be written inside the opening HTML tag using the style attribute.
    Inline styles can be used to style HTML, but it is not the best practice.
    An internal stylesheet is written using the <style> element inside the <head> element of an HTML file.
    Internal stylesheets can be used to style HTML but are also not best practice.
    An external stylesheet separates CSS code from HTML, by using the .css file extension.
